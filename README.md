# hello-world
Just another repository
Hello, my name is Monica Val, I am a Junior in the IMM program and also minoring in Graphic design. I transferrred to TCNJ from Caldwell University last semester. I've never had a real taco before and I have a teddy bear hamster that is too fluffy for his own good.
